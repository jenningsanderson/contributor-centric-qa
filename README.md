# Contributor Centric OSM Quality
ISCRAM 2017 Submission (Reworking the CHI OSM Quailty Paper)

The notebooks in this repository describe and execute each of the contributor-centric intrinsic quality metrics that this paper discusses.

### Each notebook is viewable here on GitHub with all the graphs embedded



## Metric 1: Density and Number of Contributors 
 - `Metric - Contributor Density Per Sq. Km.ipynb` Notebook goes through each of the study tiles for Density
 - `Users Active Overtime` directory has results for contributors active on each tile overtime.

## Metric 2: Level of Experience per User
 - The `User Experience` directory includes a notebook for each tile, discussing the level of user experience on each.


## Metric 3: User Geographic Focus



## Metric 4: Tile Maturity (Stage of Growth)
 - The `Metric 4 - Stages of Growth.ipynb` notebook compares each study tile to similar tiles, as well as to eachother to show the stages of tile maturity.
